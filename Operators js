3 Comparision operators
`=== // strict equal`
`>  // grether then`
`< // less then`
`>= // grethar then or equal to`
<= // lessthen or equal to`
`&& // logical and`
`|| // logical or`


the above operators can be used with diffrent data types such as number,string etc. But some of the operator such as >,>,<=,>= only works with spacial data types.

**Example:** "hi" > "hello" is not a valid comparison why? because JS engine can not compare which string is bigger. It does not make sence.

**Example:** "hi".length > "hello".length make sence because .length gives the length of the string is number or numaric value. so we can compare.
