Lets say this ant take a suger cube from A and place it in B this process contanues until no suger cube <br> left in A now imagine this process as loop.
Which is repeating somthing over and over until we as a <br> programmer tell it no to.

## while loop
```
    <keyword> <expression/value> {
      //code block
     }
    
     let i = 0
     while(i <= 10) {
      console.log(i)
      i++
     }
   ```
## For loop
```
  for(let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
    console.log(i)
  }
```
