## How to a computer worke {accroding to JONE VON NEUMAN who designe this computer working model}

|Input Form Device in CPU ⤵⤵|
     
| control processing unit (CPU)|       
| ------------- |
| * control panel |       
| * srethmetic and Logical unit |
| * Registers | 
 |     ⬆⬇  |
|memory unite or ram|
| ↪↪ Output From Device |

<dl>
  <dt>**cpu</dt>
  <dd>CPU  processing all data of computer by Three methode #Control unit, #Arithmetic and Logical unit,#Registers</dd>

  <dt>Control Unit</dt>
  <dd>It is control all data working system. It is bear the data to cpu. </dd>
  
  <dt>Arethmetic and Logical unit</dt>
  <dd>Arethmetic do the work of Oparetor like (+,-,*,/) and Logical unit do the work of set the logic of data. </dd>
  
  <dt>Registar</dt>
  <dd>Rgistar stor the data as vriable. CPU collect data from register and register collect data from memory like RAM. </dd>

## programming language difficalty chat

#### General purpose langauge
| Language Name |Speed  | Learning dificaullty|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Instraction set   | | hard |
| Assembaly | 98%  |   hard|
| C | 96%   |   heard|
| Rust | 94%   | hard |
| C++ | 92 |    head|

#### garbage coullaction, run time and byte code base langauge
| Language Name |Speed  | Learning dificaullty|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| java | 90%| mediam |
|c#  | 88%  |mediam|
| go | 86%   |mediam|
| javascript | 84%| mediam |
 |paytho  | 82%  |easy|

### Compiler vs Interpreter
<dt>They are translate program one statment at a time. Scane the entire program and translate it as a whole into machine code. Interpreter usually take less amount of time of analyge the source code.</dt>

#### *Compiler:
<dt> general parpus langauge use Compiler to translate code.  </dt>

#### *Interpeter:
<dt> GC(garbeg collector), Run time and Byte based langauge use Interpreter to tanslete code. Interpreter worke till Intermediate level.  </dt>

## Source Code to Machine Code

#### where we write code that is called source code.
