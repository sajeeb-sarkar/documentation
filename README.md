  <dd>CPU  processing all data of computer by Three methode #Control unit, #Arithmetic and Logical unit,#Registers</dd>

  <dt>Control Unit</dt>
  <dd>It is control all data working system. It is bear the data to cpu. </dd>
  
  <dt>Arethmetic and Logical unit</dt>
  <dd>Arethmetic do the work of Oparetor like (+,-,*,/) and Logical unit do the work of set the logic of data. </dd>
  
  <dt>Registar</dt>
  <dd>Rgistar stor the data as vriable. CPU collect data from register and register collect data from memory like RAM. </dd>

## programming language difficalty chat

#### General purpose langauge
| Language Name |Speed  | Learning dificaullty|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Instraction set   | | hard |
| Assembaly | 98%  |   hard|
| C | 96%   |   heard|
| Rust | 94%   | hard |
| C++ | 92 |    head|

#### garbage coullaction, run time and byte code base langauge
| Language Name |Speed  | Learning dificaullty|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| java | 90%| mediam |
|c#  | 88%  |mediam|
| go | 86%   |mediam|
| javascript | 84%| mediam |
 |paytho  | 82%  |easy|

### Compiler vs Interpreter
<dt>They are translate program one statment at a time. Scane the entire program and translate it as a whole into machine code. Interpreter usually take less amount of time of analyge the source code.</dt>

#### *Compiler:
<dt> general parpus langauge use Compiler to translate code.  </dt>

#### *Interpeter:
<dt> GC(garbeg collector), Run time and Byte based langauge use Interpreter to tanslete code. Interpreter worke till Intermediate level.  </dt>


### GC - Garbeg Collector
<dt>Every runtime based langauge have a garbage collector which immute data that we not used now..</dt>

## Source Code to Machine Code

#### where we write code that is called source code.

|Source code|
|---------|
|Laxical parser|
|Laxical analiser| 
|Optimizer|  
|Intermediat code|
|Assemly code |
|Linker |
|Executable |

#### laxical program
<dt>Whene we write code in source code that is just a text for computer. Laxical program is the first stepe for our source code to convert machine code.It is separet code key word like [div,p,span,h1,.class.id,function,let,var]</dt>

#### laxical analiser
<dt>If laxical program work is making a tree of code then laxical analiser work is analise that to see is every code in right place.</dt>

#### Optimizer
<dt>Optimizer work is cutout the aditional brance of the code of tree fro deliver the data code faster. </dt>

#### Intermediat code
<dt>Here code make as byte code, if work on runtime based programme like[ js,java,pythone] then they are now transfer the code to server side supported langauge.</dt>

#### Assemly code
<dt>Whene code cross intermediate lavel as byte code thene Assemly work is rewrite the code for machine.</dt>

#### Linker
<dt>[.dll]
[.a]
[.so]
.dll - is windows or library
     .a - static code
     .so - dinamic code
</dt>

#### Executeable

|c) JS engine (v8)|
