# Number
Numbers are an integral part of our everyday lives, right from the number of hours we sleep at night to the number of rounds we run around the racing track and much more. In math, numbers can be `even` and `odd numbers`, `prime` and `composite numbers`, `decimals`, `fractions`, `rational` and `irrational numbers`, `natural numbers`, `integers`, `real numbers`, `rational numbers`, `irrational numbers`, and `whole numbers`. 

**What are Numbers?**
A number is a basic component of mathematics. Numbers are used for counting, measuring, keeping things in order, indexing, etc.


**PEMDAS**
PEMDAS is an acronym that stands for P- Parentheses, E- Exponents, M- Multiplication, D- Division, A- Addition, and S- Subtraction.

## Types of Numbers

**Cardinal Numbers**<br>
A cardinal number is a number that denotes the count of any object. Any natural number such as `1, 2, 3, etc.`, is referred to as a cardinal number,

**Ordinal Numbers**<br>
 For example, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc. It indicates the order of things or objects, such as first, second, third, fourth, and so on.
 
 **Consecutive Numbers**<br>
Consecutive numbers are numbers that follow each other in order from the smallest number to the largest number. They usually have a difference of 1 between every two numbers.`23,24,25`

**Integers**<br>
Integers are numbers that consist of whole numbers and negative numbers. All integers are represented by the alphabet Z and do not have a decimal or a fractional par.
`Z = { ...., -4, -3, -2, -1, 0 , 1, 2, 3, 4,....}`

**Natural Numbers and Whole Numbers**<br>
A natural number is a non-negative integer and is always greater than zero. It is represented by the symbol N. It should be noted that whole numbers do not contain any decimal or fractional part. They are represented by the symbol W.
`Whole number {0,1,2,3,4....}` <br>
`natural number {1,2,3,4,5}`

**Even Numbers and Odd Numbers** <br>
Even numbers are those numbers that can be divided into two. `2,4,6`<br>
Odd numbers are whole numbers that cannot be completely divided by 2. `1,3,5,7`

**Prime Numbers and Composite Numbers**<br>
A prime number is a number that has exactly two factors, 1 and the number itself. For example, 2, 5, 7, 11, and so on are prime numbers.<br>

A composite number is a number that has more than two factors, which means it can be divided by the number 1 and itself, and at least one more integer.
`Factors of 6 = 1, 2, 3, 6 (factors other than 1 and 6)`

**Fractions and Decimals**<br>
Fractions are a part of a whole. They are represented by numbers that have two parts to them and they are separated by a fraction bar. `as 1/2` <br>

Decimals are really interesting. They have a whole number part and they can also be represented as fractions. `as 1.2`

**Rational Numbers and Irrational Numbers**<br>
A rational number, denoted by Q, is represented in the form p/q, where q is not equal to zero. Integers, Fractions, Decimals, Whole numbers, and Natural numbers are all Rational numbers. For example, 1/2, - 4/5 are rational numbers.<br>

Now, Irrational Numbers are the numbers that cannot be represented using integers in the p/q form. The set of irrational numbers is denoted by Q'. For example, √5, √2, and so on are irrational numbers.

**Real Numbers**<br>
Any number that can be found in the real world is a real number. Any number that we can think of, except complex numbers, is a real number. The set of real numbers is the union of the set of Rationals (Q) and Irrationals (Q'). It is denoted by R. The set of real numbers, R = Q ∪ Q'. The following figure shows the relationship between real numbers, rational numbers, irrational numbers, integers, whole numbers and natural numbers.

# 3 Comparision operators
`=== // strict equal`<br>
`>  // grether then`<br>
`< // less then`<br>
`>= // grethar then or equal to`<br>
`<= // lessthen or equal to`<br>
`&& // logical and`<br>
`|| // logical or`<br>


the above operators can be used with diffrent data types such as number,string etc. But some of the operator such as `>`,`>`,`<=`,`>=` only works with spacial data types.

**Example:** `"hi" > "hello"` is not a valid comparison why? because JS engine can not compare which string is bigger. It does not make sence.

**Example:** `"hi".length > "hello"`.length make sence because .length gives the length of the string is number or numaric value. so we can compare.

# Statement 
statement are used to control flow of a script or a program. The statement are composed of `values`,`expression`,`operator`,`comment` and `keywords`<br>
insort ---> Astaatement is any block of code that is perfomming some action.

**Expression:**
An expression is a block of code that evaluates to a value.

***Note:*** An expression can also be a statment, in which case we call them expression statment. but a statment as a whole can not be an expression.

**Importent:**
all comparision operator compare between one or more operators. then for all comparision operators are expression in javascript.

***Example:***
`10 >= 9` // this expression evalutes to an boolean value, which is either true or false.
