# 3 Comparision operators
`=== // strict equal`<br>
`>  // grether then`<br>
`< // less then`<br>
`>= // grethar then or equal to`<br>
`<= // lessthen or equal to`<br>
`&& // logical and`<br>
`|| // logical or`<br>


the above operators can be used with diffrent data types such as number,string etc. But some of the operator such as `>`,`>`,`<=`,`>=` only works with spacial data types.

**Example:** `"hi" > "hello"` is not a valid comparison why? because JS engine can not compare which string is bigger. It does not make sence.

**Example:** `"hi".length > "hello"`.length make sence because .length gives the length of the string is number or numaric value. so we can compare.

# Statement 
statement are used to control flow of a script or a program. The statement are composed of `values`,`expression`,`operator`,`comment` and `keywords`<br>
insort ---> Astaatement is any block of code that is perfomming some action.

**Expression:**
An expression is a block of code that evaluates to a value.

***Note:*** An expression can also be a statment, in which case we call them expression statment. but a statment as a whole can not be an expression.

**Importent:**
all comparision operator compare between one or more operators. then for all comparision operators are expression in javascript.

***Example***
`10 >= 9` // this expression evalutes to an boolean value, which is either true or false.
